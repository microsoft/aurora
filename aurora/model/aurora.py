            encoder_num_heads (tuple[int, ...], optional): Number of attention heads in each encoder
                layer. The dimensionality doubles after every layer. To keep the dimensionality of
                every head constant, you want to double the number of heads after every layer. The
                dimensionality of attention head of the first layer is determined by `embed_dim`
                divided by the value here. For all cases except one, this is equal to `64`.
            decoder_depths (tuple[int, ...], optional): Number of blocks in each decoder layer.
                Generally, you want this to be the reversal of `encoder_depths`.

            dec_mlp_ratio (float, optional): Hidden dim. to embedding dim. ratio for MLPs in the
                decoder. The embedding dimensionality here is different, which is why this is a
                separate parameter.
            perceiver_ln_eps (float, optional): Epsilon in the perceiver layer norm. layers. Used
                to stabilise the model.

            lora_mode (str, optional): LoRA mode. `"single"` uses the same LoRA for all roll-out
