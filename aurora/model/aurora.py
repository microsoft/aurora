                model. The model is sensitive to the order of `surf_vars`! Currently, adding
                one more variable here causes the model to incorrectly load the static variables.
                It is possible to hack around this. We are working on a more principled fix. Please
                open an issue if this is a problem for you.
            static_vars (tuple[str, ...], optional): All static variables supported by the
                model. The model is sensitive to the order of `static_vars`!
            atmos_vars (tuple[str, ...], optional): All atmospheric variables supported by the
                model. The model is sensitive to the order of `atmos-vars`!
            window_size (tuple[int, int, int], optional): Vertical height, height, and width of the
                window of the underlying Swin transformer.
            encoder_depths (tuple[int, ...], optional): Number of blocks in each encoder layer.
            encoder_num_heads (tuple[int, ...], optional): Number of attention heads in each encoder
                layer. The dimensionality doubles after every layer. To keep the dimensionality of
                every head constant, you want to double the number of heads after every layer. The
                dimensionality of attention head of the first layer is determined by `embed_dim`
                divided by the value here. For all cases except one, this is equal to `64`.
            decoder_depths (tuple[int, ...], optional): Number of blocks in each decoder layer.
                Generally, you want this to be the reversal of `encoder_depths`.
            decoder_num_heads (tuple[int, ...], optional): Number of attention heads in each decoder
                layer. Generally, you want this to be the reversal of `encoder_num_heads`.
            latent_levels (int, optional): Number of latent pressure levels.
            patch_size (int, optional): Patch size.
            embed_dim (int, optional): Patch embedding dimension.
            num_heads (int, optional): Number of attention heads in the aggregation and
                deaggregation blocks. The dimensionality of these attention heads will be equal to
                `embed_dim` divided by this value.
            mlp_ratio (float, optional): Hidden dim. to embedding dim. ratio for MLPs.
            drop_rate (float, optional): Drop-out rate.
            drop_path (float, optional): Drop-path rate.
            enc_depth (int, optional): Number of Perceiver blocks in the encoder.
            dec_depth (int, optioanl): Number of Perceiver blocks in the decoder.
            dec_mlp_ratio (float, optional): Hidden dim. to embedding dim. ratio for MLPs in the
                decoder. The embedding dimensionality here is different, which is why this is a
                separate parameter.
            perceiver_ln_eps (float, optional): Epsilon in the perceiver layer norm. layers. Used
                to stabilise the model.
            max_history_size (int, optional): Maximum number of history steps.
            use_lora (bool, optional): Use LoRA adaptation.
            lora_steps (int, optional): Use different LoRA adaptation for the first so-many roll-out
                steps.
